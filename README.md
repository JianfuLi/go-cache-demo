# How to use it

- Clone this repository
- Install glide (https://github.com/Masterminds/glide)
- Run `glide install` while on project root folder
- Run `make run-memory` or `make run-redis` to start the web application
- If you want to use redis, make sure you have a redis server running locally. If you don't start a new redis docker container by running `docker-compose up -d`
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
